How to run the dir_traversal?

first, you need to compile my program. you can use "make all" 
or just "make".

after the compile, just run the prog-

for example:

$mkdir dir
$touch dir/a dir/b
$ln -s a dit/sl
$mkdir dir/sub
$touch dir/sub/x

$./dir_traversal dir

output:

D 1706366 dir
F 1708038 b
D 1708661 sub
F 1708682 x
F 1708034 a


you can use "make clean" to clean all the files.

Thanks.
