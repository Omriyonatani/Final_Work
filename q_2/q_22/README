How to run the client & server ?

first, you need to compile my program. you can use "make all" 
or just "make".

after the compile, just run the prog-

for example:
at the first terminal run the server:
$./server

at the second terminal check the pid and run the client:
$pidof server
$./client <server pid> 2 1000
$./client <server pid> 10 1

explanation:
at the first row - "pidof server" we want to check the process ID of the server, you will see the num by stdout in the terminal
at the first clients row example- clinet will send 1000 signals type SIGINT to <server pid> server.
at the second clients row example- the <pid server> server will print the number of SIGINT's that received.

all of that actions work by handlers for SIGINT and SIGUSR1 that you can see at "server.c" code. 

now, after that example- you will see the number of signals are received by the server.
(it is likely that not everyone was accepted - i wrote explanation why, in the pdf that attached).


you can use "make clean" to clean all the files.

Thanks.
