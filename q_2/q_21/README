How to run check_pid ?

first, you need to compile my program. you can use "make all" 
or just "make".

after the compile, just run the prog-

for example:
./check_pid <pid>

you will see output in the stdout, 
exists- if the process is exists ( returned 0 from the "kill" signal ),
does not exist- if errno returned ESRCH
exists but we have no permission- if errno returned EPERM.


you can use "make clean" to clean all the files.

Thanks.
