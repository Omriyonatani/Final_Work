How to run the set_policy ?

first, you need to compile my program. you can use "make all" 
or just "make".

after the compile, just run the prog-

for example:
*THIS EXAMPLE IS FOR THE MOST POLICIES EXCEPT THE DEADLINE*  

at the first terminal:
$sudo ./set_policy <policy> <priority>

at the second terminal:
$pidof set_policy
$chrt -p <pid>


explanation:
first terminal:
at the first terminal you have to run the "set_policy" prog, and to decide the policy and priority that you want.
(we need to run the program with sudo because we have no permissions with the regular user.)

second terminal:
we need to check the process ID, and run the "chrt" tool to check if the priority and policy have changed.
we will see the output that shows the policy and priority.

*THE CHANGE FOR DEADLINE IS - *

at the DEADLINE policy, you need to make it a little bit different- 
when you run the:
$sudo ./set_policy 6 0 
you can see the tid (thread instead of process) of the DEADLINE thread (that it shown in stdout).
and run in another terminal-
$chrt -p <tid>
to check if the policy and priority have changed.
you will see at the stdout- policy,priority,runtime,deadline and period parameters.


you can use "make clean" to clean all the files.

Thanks.
